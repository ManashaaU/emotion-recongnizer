# emotion-recongnizer 😊


A simple yet effective text similarity application that takes user input, compares it with a labeled dataset, and returns the closest match.
It demonstrates the fundamentals of NLP, vectorization, similarity scoring, and UI development — all wrapped in a clean Streamlit interface.



# FLOW OF THE PROJECT 📲
HOW IT WORKS ?


1) Imports and loads data
2) preprocessing and vectorizes the input using TF-IDP vectorizer
3) created a simple UI setup
4)similarity matching- compares vectorized input with dataset , by cosine similarity it checks how "close" the user sentence is to the dataset 
5)displays the result - best match is shown
6) gives an option data display - a checkbox is given



#🧠 What I Learned

- How to build a text‑similarity model using TF‑IDF and cosine similarity
- Basics of NLP preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing, vectorizing)
- Creating interactive UIs with Streamlit
- Structuring a project with modular Python scripts
- Styling Streamlit apps using custom CSS
- Deploying a lightweight ML/NLP app end‑to‑end





#🔍 Key Features:

 
 1) Custom dataset with 100 labeled entries
 2) Interactive filtering and a styled frontend with CSS
 3) Fully hosted with Streamlit — lightweight and fast!
